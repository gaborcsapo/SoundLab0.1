# SoundLab0.1
A hello world app to learn Angular 2, Ionic 2 and Web Audio API

The sole purpose of the app was to familiarize myself with a few new frameworks. 
It's a simple app where a Soundcloud song is loaded and then can be altered using filters. The filters can be tweaked as well. I used tunajs for the filter implementations.

To view:
Clone, "npm install", install Ionic2, "ionic serve"
