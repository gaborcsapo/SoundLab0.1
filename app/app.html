            <p style="padding:1em;">This app has been created by Gabor Csapo in August 2016 as a simply sideproject to learn the basics of Angular 2 and Ionic 2. It was never meant to be released, is full of bugs I am aware of and there is a lot to improve (maybe in the future). It has been created using the Beta version of angular and ionic, therefore I faced a lot of hardship during development as the two frameworks contained quite a few untested, buggy components. To overcome the issues, I had to use a few hacky solutions. I believe I achieved my main goal of learning about Ionic 2.</p>
            <p style="padding:1em;">The app showcases the filters available in the Web Audio API. I intended to include pitch tweaking and paulstreching the audio sample, but the shortness of the summer and the bugs I faced didn't allow me to realize these dreams.</p>
